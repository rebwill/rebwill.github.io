							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p>
								My professional career has covered a lot of ground throughout the worlds of tech,
								startups, and social entrepreneurship in the US and Latin America. After leading
								BUILDING.co, Miami&apos;s premier coworking space for tech companies, for two years as
								the General Manager, I decided I was ready for yet another new challenge â€” so I began my
								coding journey with 4Geeks Academy&apos;s full stack web development bootcamp.
								<br />
								<br />
								I&apos;m now seeking a web developer role in the Miami area. I&apos;m proficient in
								HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, React, and PHP, and am excited to deepen my expertise
								in these technologies and continue adding new tools to my belt.
								<br />
								<br />I hold a BA in International Affairs and Anthropology from Northeastern University
								in Boston and an MBA from the Universidad de Palermo in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
								<br />
								<br />
								I&apos;m an active member of the Miami startup and tech community. I&apos;m an organizer
								of our local{" "}
								<a href="https://www.1millioncups.com/miami" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
									1 Million Cups
								</a>{" "}
								chapter; I volunteer with{" "}
								<a href="https://www.code-art.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
									Code/Art
								</a>{" "}
								to encourage young girls to get involved with coding; and I&apos;m a member of the
								Global Shapers{" "}
								<a
									href="https://www.instagram.com/globalshapersmiami/"
									target="_blank"
									rel="noopener noreferrer">
									Miami hub
								</a>{" "}
								(fun fact, I&apos;m also building our Wordpress site). I&apos;m passionate about
								promoting diversity and inclusion in our community, as well as environmental causes.
								I&apos;m also an avid scuba diver and love exploring South Florida&apos;s marine
								ecosystems. I even volunteer as a diver with the Coral Restoration Foundation in Key
								Largo!
