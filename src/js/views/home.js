							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p>
								My professional career has covered a lot of ground throughout the worlds of tech,
								startups, and social entrepreneurship in the US and Latin America. After leading
								BUILDING.co, Miami&apos;s premier coworking space for tech companies, for two years as
								the General Manager, I decided I was ready for yet another new challenge â€” so I began my
								coding journey with 4Geeks Academy&apos;s full stack web development bootcamp.
								<br />
								<br />
								I&apos;m now seeking a web developer role in the Miami area. I&apos;m proficient in
								HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, React, and PHP, and am excited to deepen my expertise
								in these technologies and continue adding new tools to my belt.
								<br />
								<br />I hold a BA in International Affairs and Anthropology from Northeastern University
								in Boston and an MBA from the Universidad de Palermo in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
								<br />
								<br />
								I&apos;m also passionate about: environment and sustainability; teaching lean startup
								methodologies; and diversity and inclusion in tech and in our city. Apart from that,
								I&apos;m an avid scuba diver and love exploring (and helping protect) South
								Florida&apos;s marine ecosystems. I also volunteer as a diver with the Coral Restoration
								Foundation in Key Largo.
